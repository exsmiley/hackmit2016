Our app makes use of the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) algorithm on datasets gathered of speeches by Trump and Hillary Clinton to find common topics. Those topics were mapped to xkcd comics. Each of the comics that the user likes counts as a vote for the candidate whose topic was associated with that comic. The candidate with the most likes is the selected candidate for the user.
