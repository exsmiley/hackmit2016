 Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32.2 MILLION.  CLINTON 27.8 MILLION.  Thank you!
 Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS.
 Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania. It would be a major media event! @CNN @FoxNews
 NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer:http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/nato-commander-agrees-members-should-pay-up/article/2598183?custom_click=rss …
 "Wow  NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS. This is a general I will like!"
 "The ""Rust Belt"" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico. END!"
 "Crooked's stop in Johnstown  Pennsylvania  where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians  drew less than 200 - with Bill  VP"

 Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania. Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA?
 "I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch. Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics  they will do much better!"
 "Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two ""Big Thursdays"" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings"

 "Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime  supports open borders  and wants massive tax hikes. A formula for disaster!"
 "Violent crime is rising across the United States  yet the DNC convention ignored it. Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities."

 No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
 "Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction  terrorism and ISIS across the world."
 "Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power  no jobs  no safety."
 Hillary will never reform Wall Street. She is owned by Wall Street!
 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
 "Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam  as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees  is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country."

 Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic
 "Our not very bright Vice President  Joe Biden  just stated that I wanted to ""carpet bomb"" the enemy. Sorry Joe  that was Ted Cruz!"
 Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about. The danger is massive. NO!
 Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally. Get tough!
 The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country. No recognition - SAD!

 "Funny  if you listen to @FoxNews  the Democrats did not have a good day. If you listen to the other two  they are fawning. What a difference"
 "Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. All of that work  energy and money  and nothing to show for it! Waste of time."
 "Elizabeth Warren  often referred to as Pocahontas  just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary  who she always hated!"
 Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution. We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs.
 "If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party  they have no future! I know more about Cory than he knows about himself."
 I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.  He asked if he could have pictures taken with me. I said fine. He then trashes on air!
 "Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold. He got NOTHING for all of the time  energy and money. The V.P. a joke!"
 "While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people  we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers."

 Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened!
 "How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails  using even religion  against Bernie!"
 "The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails  which should never have been written (stupid)  because Putin likes me"
 Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes. No way they are going to fix America's problems. ISIS & all others laughing!
 "The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good  but for the final night  my speech  great. Thank you!"
 "The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that  after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory  she's out!"
 The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing! E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well!
 "Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength  I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook!"
 "Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top  DWS. Too bad Bernie flamed out"
 "If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails  resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player. (Bernie)  media would go wild"
 "The @CNN panels are so one sided  almost all against Trump. @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher. Don't watch CNN!"
 "I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated. The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted  no energy left!"
 "Today proves what I have always known  that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one  not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets.)"
 "Sorry folks  but Bernie Sanders is exhausted  just can't go on any longer. He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect. SAD!"
 "There is no longer a Bernie Sanders ""political revolution."" He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure wants it all to end!"
 An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates.
 "Looks like the Bernie people will fight. If not  their BLOOD  SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time. Kaine stands for opposite!"
 "Wow  President Obama's brother  Malik  just announced that he is voting for me. Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else!"
 "Bernie Sanders started off strong  but with the selection of Kaine for V.P.  is ending really weak. So much for a movement! TOTAL DISRESPECT"

 I will bring jobs back and get wages up. People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years. Clinton killed jobs!
 Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved. Job killer!
 Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs. I will bring jobs back!
 Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania. Against steelworkers and miners. Husband signed NAFTA.
 "Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders. Mock his heritage and much more. On-line from Wikileakes  really vicious. RIGGED"

 "If I win the Presidency  we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions!"
 Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach. What was she thinking?
 Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct? Big mistake by an incompetent judge!
 On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party. I am spending a lot myself and also helping others.
 Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity.
 Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll. Having ZERO impact. Sad!!
 Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.pic.twitter.com/teoVCYXKOR
 Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves? Think about it and let me know!
 "The Republican platform is most 
 pro-Israel of all time!"
 New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall. We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!

 "To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests  we welcome you with open arms. People first."
 Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
 Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.

 I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters. They are not happy that he is selling out!
 "Bernie Sanders  who has lost most of his leverage  has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton. He will endorse her today - fans angry!"
 "This election is a choice between law  order & safety - or chaos  crime & violence. I will make America safe again for everyone. #ImWithYou"
 "For too many years  our inner cities have been left behind. I am going to deliver jobs  safety and protection for those in need."
 "Crime is out of control  and rapidly getting worse. Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities. Not good!"

 President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think. He is living in a world of the make believe!

 "I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago  great timing (as all know). Pols made big mistakes  now many bankruptcies."

 "Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest  incompetent and of very bad judgement."
 "Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team ""were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive  highly classified information."" Not fit!"
 Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U.S. Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong. BAD JUDGEMENT!
 "I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with ""murder."" Come November 8  she's out!"
 Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party. There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning. Lots of support! Win

 FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security. No charges. Wow! #RiggedSystem
 "The system is rigged. General Petraeus got in trouble for far less. Very very unfair! As usual  bad judgment."
 It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday. She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U.S. Will see her again!
 Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary. A total disgrace!
 "On @FoxNews at 7:00 P.M. ""Special: Meet the Trumps"" Hope you enjoy!"
 Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary? She is flying with him tomorrow. Who pays?
 "With Hillary and Obama  the terrorist attacks will only get worse. Politically correct fools  won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM!"
 "Crooked Hillary Clinton is ""guilty as hell"" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt! Where are the 33 000 missing e-mails?"
 The only people who are not interested in being the V.P. pick are the people who have not been asked!
 I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey. She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa!
 "Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday. Very impressed  great people!"
 "Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday. Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd  the end result was solid!"

 Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever. We need change!
 "The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS. 200 dead in Baghdad  worst in many years. We do not have leadership that can stop this!"
 "In Bangladesh  hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran. 20 were killed!"
 I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U.S.A.G. So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught!
 "The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting ""go away  no pictures."""
 "Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. talked only about ""grandkids"" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac?"
 """THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED!"""
 "On Saturday a great man  Elie Wiesel  passed away.The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil!"
 Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U.S.A.G. to work out a deal. The system is totally rigged & corrupt!
 Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U.S.A.G. was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know.
 "Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd  and the entire show  is against me.The good news-the people get it!"
 "It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton. Like I said  the system is totally rigged!"
 It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. What she did was wrong! What Bill did was stupid!

 Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign. The only quote that matters is a quote from me!
 "I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes  but when I won the GOP nomination  I'm in the back of the paper. Very dishonest!"
 The media is on a new phony kick about my management style. I spend much less money & get much better results! What we need as Prez!

 Crooked Hillary Clinton says that she got more primary votes than Donald Trump. But I had 17 people to beat—she had one!

 Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant. She is too easy! I'm driving her nuts.
 Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders. Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.

 On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally. Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night!
 Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work.
 Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses.
 Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness!
 Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad!
 "Wow  just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION!"

 Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work!
 "Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary. Despite a rigged delegate system  I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him."
 "I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning  Staten Island. Big crowd  will be fun!"

 "John Kasich was managing director of Lehman Brothers when it crashed  bringing down the world and ruining people's lives. A total failure!"
 "Once John Kasich announced he was running for president  and opened his mouth  people realized he was a complete & total dud!"
 "John Kasich fell right into President Obama’s trap on ObamaCare  and the people of Ohio are suffering for it. Shame!"
 Doesn’t help Kasich to do negative ads on me because he still has to go through everyone else  - he’s almost last.
 "John Kasich ad guy wanted to work for me  but his proposal was a rip off – I said NO! Now ripping Kasich."
 "I loved beating John Kasich in the debates  but it was easy—he came in dead last!"
 Kasich has already spent $6 million on ads in New Hampshire and his numbers have gone down. People from NH are smart!
 Watch Kasich squirm --- if he is not truthful in his negative ads I will sue him just for fun!
 "I want to do negative ads on John Kasich  but he is so irrelevant to the race that I don’t want to waste my money."
 "John Kasich  despite being Governor of Ohio  is losing to me in the Ohio polls. Pathetic!"
 "John Kasich should focus his special interest money on building up his failed image  not negative ads on me."
 "Governor Kasich  whose failed campaign & debating skills have brought him way down in the polls  is going to spend $2.5 million against me."

 I wonder what the rest of the world is thinking about the United States as they watch the disgusting and out of control Baltimore riots?

 "The best social program  by far  is a JOB! Our jobs are being taken away from us by China and many other countries - incompetent leader."
 "President Obama  you have a big job to do. Go to Baltimore and bring both sides together. With proper leadership  it can be done! Do it."
 "Our country has to come together. We have to start working with  and really liking   each other. The whole world is watching Baltimore."
 """@Vanderpunked: Can we drop @realDonaldTrump off in the middle of #Baltimore so he can show Obama how it's done?"" I would fix it fast!"
 "The Mayor of Baltimore said she wanted to give the rioters ""space to destroy"" - another real genius!"
 "Now that the ineffective Baltimore  Police have allowed the city to be destroyed  are the U.S. taxpayers expected to rebuild it (again)?"
 Our great African American President hasn't exactly had a positive impact on the thugs who are so happily and openly destroying Baltimore!
 Blatant and rampant property destruction in Baltimore as the police stand by and watch. Should be a lesson on how NOT to handle riots. SAD!
 "Wow  15 policemen hurt in Baltimore  some badly! Where is the National Guard. Police must get tough  and fast! Thugs must be stopped."

 “What counts is not necessarily the size of the dog in the fight - it's the size of the fight in the dog.” - Dwight D. Eisenhower
 China has a backdoor into the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This deal does not address currency manipulation. China is laughing at us.
 The Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to even greater unemployment. Do not pass it.
 Republicans should not be giving Obama fast track authority on trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership will squeeze our manufacturing sector
 The Trans-Pacific Partnership is an attack on America's business. It does not  stop Japan's currency manipulation. This is a bad deal.

 Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening. What were they thinking?
 "Our country is totally fractured and  with our weak leadership in Washington  you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places"
 "Sadly  because president Obama has done such a poor job as president  you won't see another black president for generations!"
 "As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U.S. economically  they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson!"
 Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U.S. as they watch the Ferguson riot
 "If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite  you would still be having the riots right now!"
 "Despite having a black president  the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades.If Obama were a  leader  this would not be the case"

 Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots! Not smart.
 Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal. Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators!
 ISIS is starting its own currency. May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented.
 There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome.
 Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness. Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.
